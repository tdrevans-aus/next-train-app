/**
 * uk-london-tfl direction-match gate — proves the fix for
 * docs/jim-brief-london-overground-empty-direction.md (Barking Riverside's only offered
 * direction, "Suffragette Gospel Oak", returned "No upcoming trains" even though TfL was
 * publishing 8 valid predictions for it).
 *
 * Root cause (see the brief's "CORRECTION" section): `/StopPoint/{id}/Arrivals` has no usable
 * timing for services *originating* at a terminus on these lines — every Gospel Oak-bound row at
 * Barking Riverside carried an identical placeholder `timeToStation: 2`, already in the past by
 * the time it's parsed, so `pickUpcomingTrips`'s `liveDeparture > now` filter (correctly) dropped
 * all of them. The fix routes the National-Rail-backed Overground stops (910G naptans) to
 * `/StopPoint/{id}/ArrivalDepartures`, which carries real `scheduledTimeOfDeparture` /
 * `estimatedTimeOfDeparture`; tube/DLR/tram stops keep `/Arrivals`, where timings are already
 * correct.
 *
 * Uses a checked-in fixture of raw TfL responses
 * (qa/fixtures/uk-london-tfl/direction-match-arrivals.json), captured live on 7 Sep 2026 —
 * no network access or TFL_APP_KEY required to run this script.
 *
 * Asserts, for Barking Riverside, Gospel Oak, Woodgrange Park and Barking:
 *   1. Every direction the catalog (public/city-directions/uk-london-tfl.json) offers for that
 *      station matches at least one parsed, upcoming trip from the fixture (the walk-up rule: an
 *      offered direction must not be unmatchable by construction).
 *   2. No parsed destination retains a raw "Rail Station" / "Underground Station" / "(London)"
 *      station-type or National-Rail-flavoured suffix.
 *   3. No direction's departures are all clustered within a few seconds of each other — the
 *      placeholder-timing symptom that caused this bug (Barking Riverside's Gospel Oak-bound rows
 *      all carried the same `timeToStation: 2`). A real ~15-minute-frequency service must show
 *      departures spread out, not stacked at one instant.
 *
 * Terminus handling verdict (docs/board-eligibility-rule.md): at Barking Riverside and Gospel
 * Oak — the two termini of the Suffragette line — `ArrivalDepartures` rows whose
 * `destinationName` *is* the station itself (a train terminating there, carrying neither
 * `scheduledTimeOfDeparture` nor `estimatedTimeOfDeparture`) are dropped by
 * `parseTflArrivalDeparture`: they are not a boardable departure in any offered direction.
 *
 * Usage: node qa/uk-london-tfl-direction-match.mjs
